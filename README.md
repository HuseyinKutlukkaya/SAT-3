# WHAT IS SAT3?
Sat3 checks whether the result can be 1 by giving 1 and 0 values to the entered boolean function.
For example, for the expression a+b' the result would be 1 for values a=1 b=0, but there is no combination that would make the result 1 for the expression a+a'.
Sat np is the first issue proven to be complete. There is no known effective algorithm for Sat3 problems and this idea is generally believed but not proven mathematically.
